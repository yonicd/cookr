# cookr

The goal of cookr is to track in real time the results of the 2018 US congressional election by district using a live [google spreatsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxDaxD5az6kdOjJncmGph37z0BPNhV1fNAH_g7IkpC0/htmlview?sle=true#gid=326900537) populated by [Cook political report](https://www.cookpolitical.com/), and add historical context of reported results using [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/).

The package locates which districts are still active and searches for adjacent districts to get their restults too, using this [geojson file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/4090846/raw/d534aba169207548a8a3d670c9c2cc719ff05c47/us-congress-113.json).

In the package there is a plotting function to vizualize the time depedent results. To create an output like this

Sticking a pin in this is to have data to model in the future expected voter turnout with higher frequency data.

## Installation

You can install cookr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yonicd/cookr")
```

## Usage

### Load Library

```{r}
library(cookr)
```

### Fetching The Spreadsheet

```{r,eval=FALSE}
cook_html <- httr::GET('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxDaxD5az6kdOjJncmGph37z0BPNhV1fNAH_g7IkpC0/htmlview?sle=true#gid=326900537')
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
cook_html <- readRDS('src_data/cook_spreadsheet_2018_11_19.rds')
```

```{r}
cook_data <- cook_html%>%
  cookr::fetch_spreadsheet()
```

Peek at Data

```{r}
cook_data%>%
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

Filter to open districts

```{r}
open_districts <- cook_data%>%
  cookr::cook_open()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
open_districts%>%dplyr::select(-c(state_district,home_district))%>%knitr::kable()
```

Find the adjacent districts

```{r}
adjacent_districts <- open_districts%>%
  cookr::cook_adjacent()
```

Combine Data

```{r}
districts <- dplyr::bind_rows(open_districts,adjacent_districts)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
districts%>%split(districts$home_district)%>%purrr::map(.f=function(x) x%>%dplyr::select(-c(state_district,home_district)))%>%purrr::map(knitr::kable)
```

Fetch Historical Results of the Districts From Ballotpedia

```{r,eval=FALSE}
cook_history <- districts%>%
  cook_ballotpedia()
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
cook_history <- readRDS('src_data/cook_history_2018_11_19.rds')
```

Slack is defined as the historical reported votes minus the reported votes in 2018 for each election year. The 5th,50th and 95th percentiles of this distribution is shown in the table. This measurement gives a plausible range of votes remaining to count in the open districts.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
cook_history%>%split(cook_history$home_district)%>%purrr::map(.f=function(x) x%>%dplyr::select(-c(state_district,home_district,history,results)))%>%purrr::map(knitr::kable)
```

### Plotting

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.width=7}
p <- cook_history%>%
  cook_plot()

p
```
 
### Saving 
 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave(p,filename = sprintf('plots/cook_%s.png',strftime(Sys.Date(),format = '%Y_%m_%d')))

saveRDS(cook_html,file = sprintf('src_data/cook_spreadsheet_%s.rds',strftime(Sys.Date(),format = '%Y_%m_%d')))
saveRDS(cook_history,file = sprintf('src_data/cook_history_%s.rds',strftime(Sys.Date(),format = '%Y_%m_%d')))
```
